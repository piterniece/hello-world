<h1> 1. Conduct a time audit.</h1>
<style> </style>
Start by assessing where you actually spend your time. Create a visual map of the
approximate hours you spend on work, school, housework and chores, commuting, social media, 
and leisure activities. Then, you can drill in on school or work, dividing your previous week into days, then hours.
How much time did it take to finish that paper? Did a work project take longer because you were scrolling on your phone?

Set goals based on this outcome. Planning ahead and setting time limits on your tasks and priorities can free up time
for what’s most important to you, like spending more time with friends and family.

Start by dedicating a half hour every Sunday to intentionally planning your week ahead and setting daily goals.

    At the core of time management methods are the basic skills of awareness, arrangement, and adaptation.
    This means being mindful of your time, structuring it, and adjusting it as you go, is the secret to 
    effective time management. Executives now point to behavioral skills as the most important for the modern
    workforce, with “time management skills and the ability to prioritize” ranking second in IBM’s skills gap.
