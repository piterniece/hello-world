<h1> 3. Employ methods to “chunk” your time.</h1>
Once you have a better idea of what your priorities are,
setting limits can be an excellent time management tool. 
There are several options for chunking your time into digestible pieces.

Try the Pomodoro method. This technique was developed in the late
1980s by Francesco Cirillo, a university student who was overwhelmed
by studying and assignments. The Pomodoro method requires using a timer to
break down your work into 25-minute intervals, separated by 5 minutes of
break time. After four pomodoros, you may take a longer 15-30 minute break.
Pomodoro (“tomato” in Italian) promotes concentration and relieves mental fatigue
, which is especially useful for open-ended work like conducting research, studying
for an exam, or finishing a consulting project.

By “chunking” time, you make big projects and goals less daunting. Less procrastination, more productivity.
