       <h1> 4. Focus on one thing at a time.</h1>

For most of us, multitasking is generally less efficient than focusing on
one task at a time. In fact, one study found that only 2.5 percent of people 
are able to multitask effectively [4]. Doing too many things at once can impact
your cognitive ability, making you feel unproductive or dissatisfied with your progress.
Arranging your time so that you complete one task before starting another can boost your confidence.

Further, it may be helpful to compartmentalize tasks. If you are a writer, for example,
you might dedicate Monday to research, Tuesday through Thursday to writing, and Friday to editing.
