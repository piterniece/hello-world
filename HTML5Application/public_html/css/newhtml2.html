<h1> 2. Use the Eisenhower Matrix to set your priorities.</h1>
The Eisenhower Matrix is a popular tool that helps you distinguish between tasks that are important, 
not important, urgent, and not urgent. The quadrant has four boxes in which you can split your tasks to prioritize
what you should focus on first. They also correspond with the 4 D’s of execution: do, defer, delegate, and delete.
<ul>
<li>Quadrant 1: Important and urgent. Do these tasks first. These are the priorities that are most relevant to your goals.</li>

<li>Quadrant 2: Important but not urgent. Defer these for later in your schedule.</li>

<li>Quadrant 3: Urgent but not important. Delegate these to others, if possible, especially if
they do not contribute to your long-term goals.</li>

<li>Quadrant 4: Not important and not urgent. Delete these tasks, or do them when you have free
time because they are distractions from your priorities.</li>
</ul>
For an even simpler approach, create a task list and mark each item as urgent or important.
Often, we prioritize urgent tasks instead of important ones—such as tasks that may be creative,
important, and fulfilling but do not have a deadline—so identifying and labeling them can be a helpful
step toward accomplishing your personal and professional goals.
