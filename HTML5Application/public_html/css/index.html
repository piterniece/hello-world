        Time management is the process of consciously planning and controlling time spent on specific 
        tasks to increase how efficient you are. You may be familiar with setting deadlines, writing to-do
        lists, and giving yourself small rewards for accomplishing certain activities.

Motivating ourselves is a core part of time management—and it takes a bit of effort not only to motivate 
yourself but to cultivate good habits to work and live more efficiently.

To develop good routines and habits, you can start by knowing what strategies and best
practices are out there. You can experiment with them in your own life to see what works for you.
